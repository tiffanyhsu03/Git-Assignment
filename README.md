## Facebook Browser API
 This article is about an API created by Facebook to improve JavaScript execution times and event loading on Google Chrome. It talks about how Facebook noticed that the time between a person interacting with their website and them starting to process it was often delayed. The new isInputPending API allows developers to see if there is any input pending, preventing the need for making a tradeoff between loading the page quickly and responding to events quickly. I thought this was a clever solution to a problem that affects all web developers. It's also interesting that even though Facebook and Google are often competitors, they collaborated to make this happen. This just goes to show how in today's tech world eveything is interconnected and companies often have to help each other to help themselves.

definitely something developers who are also looking to get rid of queueing delays and improve interaction and loading performance should try out.
